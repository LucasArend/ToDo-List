# React ToDo list challange

# About the challenge

In this challenge, was asked to develop a task control application in the **to-do list** style, which contains the following features:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as completed
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress

Although they have few features, i need to remember concepts such as:

- States
- Immutability of the state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization
